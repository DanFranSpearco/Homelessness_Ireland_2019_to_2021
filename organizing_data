##Changing data types in order to analyze later

##These first changes are for a column that are for string objects which are only found in these months

feb20['Number of Adults in Families'] = feb20['Number of Adults in Families'].str.replace(',','').astype(float)
oct21['Number of Adults in Families'] = oct21['Number of Adults in Families'].str.replace(',','').astype(float)
sep21['Number of Adults in Families'] = sep21['Number of Adults in Families'].str.replace(',','').astype(float)
aug21['Number of Adults in Families'] = aug21['Number of Adults in Families'].str.replace(',','').astype(float)
may21['Number of Adults in Families'] = may21['Number of Adults in Families'].str.replace(',','').astype(float)
april21['Number of Adults in Families'] = april21['Number of Adults in Families'].str.replace(',','').astype(float)
feb21['Number of Adults in Families'] = feb21['Number of Adults in Families'].str.replace(',','').astype(float)

##Concatenating these files to transform the data types. All of these files have the same columns as string objects. They are being transformed into floats for analysis
toclean = pd.concat([jan21,jan19,feb21,feb20,feb19,mar19,april21,april19,may21,may19,june19,july19,aug21,aug19,sep21,sep19,oct21,oct19,nov19,dec19])

##These files are already numeric, and ready to go.
clean = pd.concat([jan20,mar20,april20,may20,june20,june21,july20,aug20,sep20,oct20,nov20,dec20])
dec20['Number of Adults in Families'] = dec20['Number of Adults in Families'].str.replace(',','').astype(float)

##Cleaning the data

toclean['Total Adults'] = toclean['Total Adults'].str.replace(',','').astype(float)
toclean['Male Adults'] = toclean['Male Adults'].str.replace(',','').astype(float)
toclean['Female Adults'] = toclean['Female Adults'].str.replace(',','').astype(float)
toclean['Adults Aged 25-44'] = toclean['Adults Aged 25-44'].str.replace(',','').astype(float)
toclean['Adults Aged 45-64'] = toclean['Adults Aged 45-64'].str.replace(',','').astype(float)
toclean['Number of people who accessed Private Emergency Accommodation'] = toclean['Number of people who accessed Private Emergency Accommodation'].str.replace(',','').astype(float)
toclean['Number of people who accessed Supported Temporary Accommodation'] = toclean['Number of people who accessed Supported Temporary Accommodation'].str.replace(',','').astype(float)
toclean['Number of Dependants in Families'] = toclean['Number of Dependants in Families'].str.replace(',','').astype(float)

##Now, joining both files together, and ready to analyze

hmls = pd.concat([toclean,clean])
